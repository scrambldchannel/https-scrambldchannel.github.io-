Title: About
Date: 2019-09-26 10:02

I'm a BI/data analyst/developer with over ten years of experience across several sectors. I've largely worked on systems that support the financial planning and analysis and wider finance functions. I've worked a lot with IBM Cognos TM1 / Planning Analytics but am also familiar with a wide array of other database, ETL, reporting and data visualisation technologies as well as languages such as Python. 
 
I've maintained an interest in open source software since university and can still remember the days when Debian came on seven CDs and just getting a graphical desktop took all weekend (but your soundcard still didn't work). I make the odd contribution to Github when time allows but I also keep myself busy outdoors and away from screens with things like hiking, cycling and exploring my (relatively) new home in Berlin. 
 
This blog is a way to pull together ideas, play with new tech and develop new skills. Right now I'm interested in data analysis with Python, data visualisation, building and consuming data from APIs, maps, podcasting, photography and all things open. 
 
Cheers
Alex
